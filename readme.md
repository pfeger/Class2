Brick breaker

Paddle at the bottom with bricks at the top. Some sort of "ball" bouncing around that breaks the bricks. 

Possibly add a framerate/time element to it with the bricks falling. Once the bricks pass the paddle on the bottom you lose.

3 balls/lives total.

Breaking a certain amount of bricks awards player an extra "ball" or life.
